// Given an unsorted array of integers.
// Find third largest number in array.
// Try to use most optimized solution.
// example: [4, 5, 1, 2, 9, 6]. Answer: 5, since 9 is largest and 6 is second largest.
// Restrictions: You can use just plain C#, do not use LINQ.

int[] arr = {
      9, 2, 5, 2, 1, 15, 8, 0, -1, -7, 3, 5, 10, 1
};

Console.WriteLine("Third max element is: ...");
